Project Title: Students’ Habits and Academic Performance

# Summary
This project explores how lifestyle choices such as study hours, sleep, screen time, and mental health impact student academic performance.
What caught my attention in this dataset was the wide range of behavioral and lifestyle factors — allowing us to examine how everyday decisions shape educational outcomes.

# Business Problem
How can students improve their academic performance and well-being by adjusting their daily habits?

# Questions Explored:
	•	Which daily habit most strongly influences exam scores?
	•	Does more study time equal better results?
	•	What’s the impact of screen time and sleep on performance?
	•	Is there a healthy balance that leads to top scores?

# Tools Used
	•	Microsoft Excel – Data Cleaning, Regression Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Coefficient Interpretation
	•	Power BI – Data Visualization, KPI Tracking, Dashboard Creation, DAX Measures

# Steps Taken

1. Data Cleaning (Excel)
	•	Auto-fitted rows and columns for readability
	•	Verified there were no missing values
	•	Checked for and confirmed no duplicates
	•	Ensured all columns had the correct data types
	•	Reviewed for invalid or inconsistent entries (all data valid)
	•	Standardized category labels and formatting

2. Data Analysis
	•	Multiple Linear Regression
	•	Study time had the biggest impact — each additional hour predicted +9.57 points in exam score
	•	Positive predictors: Study time, attendance, mental health
	•	Negative predictors: Social media use, Netflix hours
	•	Neutral predictors: Sleep and exercise
	•	Hypothesis Testing (Independent T-Test)
	•	Compared exam scores between students with high vs. low mental health ratings
	•	Purpose: To determine if mental health significantly affects academic performance

3. Data Visualization (Power BI)
	•	Scatter Plot – Showed a clear positive trend between study time and exam scores
	•	Bar Chart – Highlighted how study time and screen time affect academic performance
	•	KPI Cards – Displayed averages for exam scores, study time, sleep, and mental health and DAX for High performers.

# Key Findings
	•	Students who study more tend to score higher
	•	Most high performers fall in the “High” mental health group
	•	Excessive screen time negatively affects exam performance
	•	Sleep showed minimal direct impact, but poor sleep often aligned with lower scores

# Recommendations
	•	Encourage consistent and focused study habits
	•	Provide mental health support and check-ins
	•	Promote screen time for educational purposes
	•	Identify students at risk early and offer support programs
## 2. Screen Time Analysis

I tracked 7 days of my digital activity to understand my screen time habits and how they impact my productivity and routine.

# Key Findings
# Patterns and Trends
YouTube dominates my app usage, far ahead of any other app.
My overall screen time dips mid-week, likely due to a busier schedule and fewer distractions during that time.
# Surprises
The biggest surprise was the huge gap between YouTube and all other applications — it wasn’t even close.
# Expectations Vs Reality
I expected entertainment to be the top category, but I didn’t anticipate just how much time I was spending specifically on YouTube.
# Recommendations
I should set a daily YouTube limit or schedule watch times. I could also consider reallocating some of that time to more educational content or screen-free activities.
# What the Data Tells Me About My Habits
	•	My phone pickups are high, averaging 81 per day, which may suggest frequent interruptions or unconscious habit-driven checking.
	•	I tend to use my phone more at the start and end of the week, with a noticeable dip in the middle — possibly due to changes in my daily routine or workload.
