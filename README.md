Project Title: Students’ Habits and Academic Performance

# Summary
This project explores how lifestyle choices such as study hours, sleep, screen time, and mental health impact student academic performance.
What caught my attention in this dataset was the wide range of behavioral and lifestyle factors — allowing us to examine how everyday decisions shape educational outcomes.

# Business Problem
How can students improve their academic performance and well-being by adjusting their daily habits?

# Questions Explored:
	•	Which daily habit most strongly influences exam scores?
	•	Does more study time equal better results?
	•	What’s the impact of screen time and sleep on performance?
	•	Is there a healthy balance that leads to top scores?

# Tools Used
	•	Microsoft Excel – Data Cleaning, Regression Analysis, Coefficient Interpretation
	•	Power BI – Data Visualization, KPI Tracking, Dashboard Creation

# Steps Taken

1. Data Cleaning (Excel)
	•	Auto-fitted rows and columns for readability
	•	Verified there were no missing values
	•	Checked for and confirmed no duplicates
	•	Ensured all columns had the correct data types
	•	Reviewed for invalid or inconsistent entries (all data valid)
	•	Standardized category labels and formatting

2. Data Analysis
	•	Multiple Linear Regression
	•	Study time had the biggest impact — each additional hour predicted +9.57 points in exam score
	•	Positive predictors: Study time, attendance, mental health
	•	Negative predictors: Social media use, Netflix hours
	•	Neutral predictors: Sleep and exercise
	•	Hypothesis Testing (Independent T-Test)
	•	Compared exam scores between students with high vs. low mental health ratings
	•	Purpose: To determine if mental health significantly affects academic performance

3. Data Visualization (Power BI)
	•	Scatter Plot – Showed a clear positive trend between study time and exam scores
	•	Bar Chart – Highlighted how different habits affect academic performance
	•	Pie Chart – Showed over half of top scorers had high mental health ratings
	•	KPI Cards – Displayed averages for exam scores, study time, sleep, and mental health

# Key Findings
	•	Students who study more tend to score higher
	•	Most high performers fall in the “High” mental health group
	•	Excessive screen time negatively affects exam performance
	•	Sleep showed minimal direct impact, but poor sleep often aligned with lower scores

# Recommendations
	•	Encourage consistent and focused study habits
	•	Provide mental health support and check-ins
	•	Promote screen time for educational purposes
	•	Identify students at risk early and offer support programs
